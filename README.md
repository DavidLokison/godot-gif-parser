# Godot GIF Parser
GDScript wrapper for loading GIF files from a `PackedByteArray` buffer and transforming them to an `AnimatedTexture`.

## Installation and Usage
Add this repository as a submodule. (to be defined)

## Credits
The script is mainly based on the work of [godot-gif-importer](https://github.com/vbousquet/godot-gif-importer), which I updated to Godot 4.3 stable and reformatted to be used as a submodule.

This script also uses [godot-gif-lzw](https://github.com/DavidLokison/godot-gif-lzw), forked from [here](https://github.com/jegor377/godot-gif-lzw), as a submodule.

## Contributing
Any contribution is greatly appreciated!
